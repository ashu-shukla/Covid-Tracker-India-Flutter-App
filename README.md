# Covid Tracker India

Live tracking app for Covid-19 cases in India.

## About

A live tracker for covid-19 cases in India. It contains state and district wise statistics of confirmed, recovered and death cases due to covid-19. It enables the user to navigate through all state statistics in just a click. 

Information is updated at intervals throughout the day; differences are indicated in comparison to previous data.

## Why not on Play Store or App Store?

Play Store and App Store only authorizes Govt. or public healthcare approved apps when it comes to Covid-19 related apps. I came to know about this while publishing the app(after a 4 day approval wait period).

Data displayed is sourced from open source data base(link in app) which is also complied with the data of MoHFW, Govt. of India.
