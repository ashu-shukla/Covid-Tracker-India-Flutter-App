  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - assets/images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - assets/images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  
  # or to include all assets from a directory do this:
  # assets:
  #   - assets/images/
  
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  assets:
    - assets/images/
  
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
